<h1> Fract-ol </h1>

<h4>Fractal geometry is the branch of mathematics that studies the properties and behavior of fractals.
It describes many situations that cannot be easily explained by classical geometry, and has been applied in science,
technology and computer-generated art.
A fractal is a geometric object that can be divided into parts, each of which is similar to the original object.
Fractals are said to have infinite detail, are usually self-similar and scale. In many cases a fractal can be generated by a repeated pattern,
typically a recursive or iterative process.</h4>
