<h1> Fract-ol </h1>

<h3>Fractal geometry is the branch of mathematics that studies the properties and behavior of fractals.</h3>

-  It describes many situations that cannot be easily explained by classical geometry, and has been applied in science,
technology and computer-generated art.

- A fractal is a geometric object that can be divided into parts, each of which is similar to the original object.
Fractals are said to have infinite detail, are usually self-similar and scale. In many cases a fractal can be generated by a repeated pattern,
typically a recursive or iterative process.</h4>
